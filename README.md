This is a c++ practice project. 

Objective:
A simple json parser which take the json file name via command line argument as input and store the result in an unoreded map. 

Limitation: 
As this is a practice project, I decided to reduce the complexity by making some assumptions. 

1. The JSON file is always valid. 
2. There are only three types of value for the json file. String, Integer and decimals. 
3. All numeric values are postitive. 
4. The result is stored in the form unordered_map<string, value type>
